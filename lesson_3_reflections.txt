When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repository would be useful for times when I am away from my work computer or on
a computer that isn't setup with git.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling automatically might be a problem if two or more people are accessing and editing the 
same repositories and branches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?

A branch exists within a single repository, while forks and clones operate between two
different repositories.  A clone is a copy of a git repository either from github to 
your local drive, or between two locations on your local drive.  A fork is like a clone
but only between two repositories on github.
