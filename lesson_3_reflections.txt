When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repository would be useful for times when I am away from my work computer or on
a computer that isn't setup with git.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling automatically might be a problem if two or more people are accessing and editing the 
same repositories and branches.
