What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git adds the .git file to the directory,
but doesn't create a commit yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because it contains 
only those files to be added to the next commit, and not every file in the 
directory.  It differs from the repository because it contains only the changes
to be added to the next commit, while the repository contains all commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can check the staging area by using the "git diff" to see the changes that were last
added to the staging area, and "git diff --staged" to compare the differences between the
last commit and the changes in the staging area.
