What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git adds the .git file to the directory,
but doesn't create a commit yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because it contains 
only those files to be added to the next commit, and not every file in the 
directory.  It differs from the repository because it contains only the changes
to be added to the next commit, while the repository contains all commits.
